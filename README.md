# BANK_ATM_GUI_JAVA
This is a bank interface application that you can withdraw,deposit or transfer amounts between users.
File reading and writing processes were used.
This project was created with https://github.com/galtonova.

First idea is to reading values from the text provided In a nutshell ,file reading.To collect users, user[]  was created. After that we should be certain whether the user properties from user class are compeletely read or not.When program is certain that users given in the file are compeletely read then it would be stopping to read.To be certain about reading period we used two characters such as '*' and '+'.When user informations are read from the veri.txt program controls the file with if conditions. When there is '*' code passes to other user and in any existence of'+' character the whole reading process will be stopped.
